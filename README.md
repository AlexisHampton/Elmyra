A game that promises a dynamic world with alive, reactionary NPCs and a world that evolves 

May 2023 - ???
My current project that will be released on Itch.io on release

I've currently implemented NPC AI where NPCs can find tasks that relate to a schedule they build as they go that only resets every Sunday (in-game time).

Hopefully, they will interact with the player and with each other! And this will attempt to facilitate a gameplay style where players don't have to be forced to create their fun, but will be an immersive reactive experience like Hitman 3.
